## Libraries and Data

Data is part of the Tidy Tuesday collection. Found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-04-14/readme.md).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)


polls <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-04-14/polls.csv')
rankings <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-04-14/rankings.csv')

```




```{r}
rankings %>% 
  count(artist, sort = TRUE)

polls %>% 
  distinct(critic_name)

polls %>% 
  count(critic_country, sort = T)

  
polls <- polls %>% 
  separate(artist, into = c("artist", "featured"), sep = "ft. ") %>% 
  mutate(
    featured = case_when(
      featured == "Snoop Doggy Dogg" ~ "Snoop Dogg",
      TRUE ~ as.character(featured)),
    artist = case_when(
      artist == "Snoop Doggy Dogg" ~ "Snoop Dogg",
      TRUE ~ as.character(artist))
    )


polls %>%
  filter(!is.na(featured)) %>% 
  count(featured, sort = T)
  
  
```
